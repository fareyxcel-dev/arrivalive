# UI Polish Plan - COMPLETED

All items from the comprehensive UI polish plan have been implemented:

1. ✅ 22 unique glass presets with individual CSS keyframe animations (shimmer, ripple, prismatic rotate, glitch, bounce, vapor, etc.)
2. ✅ Notification bell pulse removed - active/inactive now distinguished by static glow only
3. ✅ Header weather text fixed - uses conditional rendering instead of absolute positioning overlay
4. ✅ Extended flight cards always show SCH/Tracker/EST - landed shows landed time, cancelled shows cancelled time as centerText
5. ✅ Airline logo IATA mappings added: H4, OQ, C6, HB, MF, FD (Thai AirAsia)
6. ✅ Font styles visible during scroll - observer uses ref instead of state, fontFamily always applied
7. ✅ Dual glass uses scrollable grid UI instead of dropdowns
8. ✅ Glass sliders/toggles styled via CSS overrides in index.css
9. ✅ Glass-interactive brightness gradience on hover/active states
10. ✅ DiagnosticsPanel build error fixed (pushManager typed as any)
